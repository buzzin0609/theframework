# The Framework
The Framework is an extremely light weight API building framework for NodeJS.
It has very few dependencies, doesn't use Express (or any other framework), and is very fast ðŸ”¥.

## Installing
``
npm install the-framework --save
``

## Quick Setup
Place the following code in your main app file

```javascript
const theFramework = require("the-framework");
const PORT = process.env.PORT;

theFramework.startServer({
    authenticationMethod: async (req, token) => {
        // Optional method to check user token and return either a user object or null (if you cannot authenticate your user)
        if (token) {
            // Code to check token
        }

        return null;
    },
    apiDirectory: "/api", // Directory you will store your route files in
    userTokenHeader: "x-user-token", // Header you will use for your user toens
    port: PORT
});
```
